Use Elly and Blocks to understand mapreduce.
Go through TeraSort.

Djoin improvements:
* Let slaves read chunks instead of sending from namenode.
* Use that to generate keypool.
* DONE Get rid of the sleeps, be clear about syncing, use remotecall_fetch.
* DONE Use communicate_push because it will reduce the function calls.
* Put the join files in a HDFS folder instead of vcatting in a single node.
* Compare with unix join.
* Additional things:
** Send indexes (byte offset) or entire rows ?
** Parallel Sort after join.
