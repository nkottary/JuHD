* Compare time spent on communicate with time spent in loding chunks in the cluster setup.

Djoin improvements:
* Let workers read chunks instead of sending from namenode.
* Use that to generate keypool.
* Put the join files in a HDFS folder instead of vcatting in a single node.
* Compare with unix join.
* Additional things:
** Send indexes (byte offset) or entire rows ?
** Parallel Sort after join.
** Go through TeraSort.
